# Data Journalism

- **_Health Risk Demographics_** - Is based off 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) and explores health risks that face certain demographics. The idea is to provide an interactive chart that looks at 6 factors, 3x3 comparisions of Poverty, Age and Household Income versus Healthcare, Smoking and Obesity. You can interactively click the x and y axis labels and the charts will dynamically change. You can glean trends from the results and then use them to support the conculsions in a journalistic article.

## Files

- [`D3_data_journalism/index.html`](D3_data_journalism/index.html) - Index page that has the base html to place the chart and demographic selections

- [`D3_data_journalism/assets/js/app.js`](D3_data_journalism/assets/js/app.js) - The primary application code file, it contains the code to initialize the chart and demographic elements and then capture events to update the page based upon the demographics clicked in the chart label

- [`D3_data_journalism/assets/data/data.csv`](D3_data_journalism/assets/data/data.csv) - The source data set for Health Risk Demographics
